This is a fintech web application. This app simulates common transactions such as SEND MONEY
TRANSFER, and PAYMENT (adding credit into your own account).

This App is Developed with React.js & Next.js. 
The beautiful UI is designed with Material-UI.

User data is stored on Mongodb.

Here's a version of same App hosted live on heroku at https://monyapps.herokuapp.com/

This app is hosted on Amazon (Serverless) with AWS Amplify and Github-Actions as a DevOps pipeline.

Notice: AWS may have limited major operations of the version below (it's a free service). 
So I recommend the heroku link above. Operations such as login, payment etc periodically fail due to server side blocking the requests.
The live App can be viewed at https://master.dv27rgm0nsygk.amplifyapp.com/

To send money to someone, you need to have their 14 digit code.

This App is fun, Enjoy.
